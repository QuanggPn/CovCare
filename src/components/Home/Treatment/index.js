                      To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or
                      treat COVID-2019.

                    However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with
                    serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to
                    supportive care.

                    Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses. Treatment aims to
                    relieve the symptoms while your body fights the illness. You'll need to stay in
                    isolation, away from other people, until you have recovered.
